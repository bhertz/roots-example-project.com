# Roots Example Project [DEPRECATED]

This repository was an example of how to integrate three of [Roots'](https://roots.io/) projects together:

* [Bedrock](https://github.com/roots/bedrock)
* [Trellis](https://roots.io/trellis/)
* [Sage](https://roots.io/sage/)

It has been deprecated and archived to prevent users from following an outdated example.

See our [official docs](https://docs.roots.io/trellis) for details on setting up a project with Trellis, Bedrock, and Sage.
